# 42 C++ Piscine Modules

These are my solutions for each module of the C++ Piscine.  
The READMEs covering the notions required for most of the modules are either hand-written, hand-written and formatted with AI, or fully AI-generated (_then updated and modified to feat my needs at the time_).  
> Some READMEs also include additional information I found during my research process.  
> Note: certain content is not strictly based on C++98, but it is still useful to know that it exists.
